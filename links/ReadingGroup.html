    <H1><font color="blue">Welcome to the Formal Methods Group!</font></H1>
    <p>    We are a group of mainly professors and students interested in applying <i>formal methods</i> to various domains.
        We typically meet on Wednesdays, at 6 PM, in 045 C, at UVT main building.</p>

    By <i>formal methods</i> we understand applying <i>symbolic computation</i> methods, in particular <i>computational logic</i>,
    to rigorously reasoning about properties of computer programs.
    Relevant program property is <i>correctness</i> with respect to a <i>specification</i>.

    <p>The term <i>formal methods</i> refers to both <i>modeling</i> the system/software as mathematical entities and to the <i>(automated)
        verification</i> process
        of system properties in a throughout fashion.</p>

    <p>Hence, formal methods comprise of at least two aspects. <i>Specification</i> means to describe the conditions on the input program
        variables (precondition) and the expected behavior of a program (output condition) in a mathematically precise way.</p>
    <i>(Complete) verification</i> means to demonstrate using mathematical rigor that every possible execution of the program does not
            crash and indeed satisfies its specification, preferably with computer support (automated reasoners, SAT/SMT solving).

    <p>Many times, the complete verification of a program may is not feasible, hence a loose  approach is used to increase
        the confidence in the correctness of a program:<p>
        <ul type="1">
            <li> <i>Extended Static Checking</i> and <i>Bounded Model Checking</i> apply logic-based techniques to detect
                errors in a program.
            <li> <i>Runtime Verification</i> supervises the execution of a program by an automatically generated monitor
    that triggers a warning if the program violates its specification.
        </ul>
    <p>Also the loose approach is supported by automatic tools like static program analyzers, model checkers, etc.</p>

    <p>    <font color="red">In the Winter Semester 2019/2020, we will focus on the verification of binarized neural networks.</font>
