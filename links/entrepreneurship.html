    <H1>Entrepreneurship</H1>
    <p>I was a Fulbright-RAF scholar in the domain of entrepreneurship and entreprenerial studies at University of Rochester, Ain Center for Entrepreneurship.
    During the scholaship, I activelly participated in the following courses: Technical Entrepreneurship (class assignments, business plan and pitching of a possible start-up),
    Product Development & Technical Management (class assignments), New Venture Developement (business plan and pitching of a possible start-up). I was also an observer at a lecture
    on Entrepreneurial Finance. Apart from this, I took part in: (1) different entrepreneurship programs for students/researchers (Innov8, e5, NSF I-Corps, Embark), (2) angel investors meetings,
    (3) judge in the Forbes Entrepreneurial Competition. </p>

    <p>The experience acquired will be used in the implementation of the following courses for Computer Science students at West University starting Fall semester 2022:
    Entrepreneurial skills (compulsory, second year, first semester) and Entrepreneurial skills - applications (facultative, second year, second semester).</p>

    <p>I am also organizing the Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute and I am involved in the Innovation Labs program.</p>



    <p style="color:blue">Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</p>
    <p>In the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of West University of Timisoara started on the academic year 2020 - 2021 a series of
        meetings called <b>Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</b>. These aim to be informal meetings that facilitate the learning and practice of
        entrepreneurship targeted for Computer Science students (and not only). As a bonus, students can make new friends, build new relationships and get
        inspired.</p>
    <p>Meetings are held online on Wednesdays every 2 weeks, usually from 6 PM, except students vacations and exam sessions. We alternate theory meetings
        with guests (local/national/international entrepreneurs).</p>
