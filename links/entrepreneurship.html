    <H1>Entrepreneurship</H1>
    <p><i>In my opinion, entrepreneurship as a way of living: you see a problem (in your family, at work, in your city,
    worldwide) and you try to solve it, if it?s in your power. It does not always guarantee a pleasant life, as
    most of the time you must step out of your comfort zone, but this is compensated by the good and
    meaningful life you craft for yourself and for the others. This is what I want to pass on to my students. The rest are details.</i></p>
    <p>During January - May 2022, I was a Fulbright-RAF scholar in the domain of entrepreneurship and entreprenerial studies at University of Rochester,
        Ain Center for Entrepreneurship.
        During the scholaship, I activelly participated in the following courses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <i> Technical Entrepreneurship (class assignments, business plan and pitching of a possible start-up),</i> </li>
        <li> <i> Product Development & Technical Management (class assignments), </i> </li>
        <li> <i> New Venture Developement (business plan and pitching of a possible start-up). </i> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was also an observer at a lecture  on <i>Entrepreneurial Finance</i>. Apart from this, I took part in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <i> different entrepreneurship programs for students/researchers (Innov8, e5, NSF I-Corps, Embark),</i> </li>
        <li> <i>  angel investors and VCs meetings,</i> </li>
        <li> <i>  judge in the Forbes Entrepreneurial Competition. </i> </li>
    </ul>
        </p>

    <p>The experience acquired will be used in the implementation of the following courses for Computer Science students at West University starting Fall semester 2022:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <i> Entrepreneurial skills (compulsory, second year, first semester) </i></li>
        <li> <i> Entrepreneurial skills - applications (facultative, second year, second semester).</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am also organizing the <b style="color: blue"> Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</b> and I am involved in the <b style="color: blue"> Innovation Labs</b> program.</p>

    <H3 style="color: blue">Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</H3>
    <p>In the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of West University of Timisoara started on the academic year 2020 - 2021 a series of
        meetings called <b>Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</b>. These aim to be informal meetings that facilitate the learning and practice of
        entrepreneurship targeted for Computer Science students (and not only). As a bonus, students can make new friends, build new relationships and get
        inspired.</p>
    <p>Meetings are held online on Wednesdays every 2 weeks, usually from 6 PM, except students vacations and exam sessions. We alternate theory meetings
        with guests (local/national/international entrepreneurs).</p>
    <p>To receive news about our meetings or related event, subscribe to our mailing list: <b>entrepreneurship_cafee at e-uvt dot ro</b>.</p>
