    <H1>Applications for PhD Studies</H1>
    <p>
        The Romanian IT sector is currently experiencing a period of uncertainty, as many companies have reduced or relocated their operations.
        Consequently, some students and professionals are finding it difficult to secure positions in industry and consider pursuing a PhD.
        Others view doctoral studies as an opportunity for professional retraining, particularly in the field of machine learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        In recent years, I have been approached by candidates only days before application deadlines, as well as by colleagues seeking a formal supervisor for students who need a PhD to qualify for future academic positions.
        I have also received inquiries from prospective students who were unable to identify which of my research areas they wished to pursue.
        Such situations suggest a misunderstanding of what a doctoral program entails, at least in the context of my supervision style and expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        (If you are unsure about what a PhD truly involves, feel free to consult ChatGPT or other reputable sources.)
    </p>

    <p>
        To ensure a productive and mutually beneficial collaboration, I kindly ask prospective PhD candidates to consider the following guidelines:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ideally, we should have worked together previously (e.g., during Bachelor's or Master's studies) or you should come with a strong recommendation from a trusted colleague.</li>
        <li>Your research interests should align clearly with my ongoing work.</li>
        <li>I maintain an active and engaged supervision style, which includes regular meetings and continuous feedback.</li>
        <li>You should be open to constructive criticism.</li>
        <li>A PhD is a long-term commitment: more a marathon than a sprint.</li>
        <li>The doctoral thesis should be completed within the time limits set by Romanian regulations (maximum 4 years). Extending the program is not desirable for either of us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If these expectations resonate with you and your aspirations, I welcome you to reach out for a discussion about potential supervision.
    </p>

    <H1>Applications for PostDoc Studies</H1>
    <hr>
    <p>I only accept post-doctoral candidates whom I have previously worked with, who come recommended by trusted colleagues, and whose research areas align with and can contribute to my own.
