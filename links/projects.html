    <H1>Applications for PhD Studies</H1>
    <p>
        Since 2025, Romania?s tech sector has faced heightened uncertainty, with many companies scaling down or relocating. As a result, some students and professionals are finding it harder to secure industry roles and are considering a PhD. Others see doctoral studies as an opportunity for professional retraining, particularly in machine learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regardless of these broader trends, I have noticed several recurring patterns among applicants.
        Since I began supervising PhD theses in October 2024, 2025 was my first full year in this role.
        During this time, I have been approached by candidates only a few days before application deadlines,
        as well as by colleagues seeking a formal supervisor for students who need a PhD to qualify for future academic positions.
        I have also received inquiries from prospective students who were unable to articulate which of my research areas they wished to pursue.
        <em>These situations suggest a partial misunderstanding of what doctoral study entails, at least in the context of my supervision style and expectations.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are unsure what a PhD typically involves, you may find it helpful to consult general online resources.    </p>

    <p>
        To ensure a productive and mutually beneficial collaboration, I kindly ask prospective PhD candidates to consider the following guidelines:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ideally, we should have worked together previously (e.g., during Bachelor's or Master's studies).
        </li>
        <li>
            Your interests should align with my ongoing work. If this is not immediately evident, please make a compelling case (e.g. a preliminary study, experimental results, a well-argued proposal) that there is a realistic basis for joint research.        </li>
        <li>
            My supervision style is engaged and iterative, with regular meetings and continuous feedback. You should be comfortable with constructive criticism and willing to revise your work accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>A PhD is a long-term commitment (typically 3-4 years). It is a marathon, not a sprint, hence ustained effort matters.
        </li>
        <li>The thesis should be completed within the limits set by Romanian regulations (maximum 4 years).
            Extensions are possible but not desirable for either of us.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If these expectations resonate with you and your expectations, I welcome you to reach out for a discussion about potential supervision.
    </p>
