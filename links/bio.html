<p>M&#259;d&#259;lina ERA&#350;CU, PhD, is a Associate Professor in the <a href="http://math.uvt.ro/">Department of Computer Science</A> of
  <a href="http://www.uvt.ro/">West University of Timisoara</A>, Romania and Researcher at <a href="http://www.ieat.ro/">Institute e-Austria</a>,
  Timisoara, Romania. Prior to these, she had been Lecturer, Associated Assistant and Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science of the same university
as well as Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/description/">Theorema</a> group at
<a href="https://www.risc.jku.at/">Research Institute for Symbolic Computation</a>,
<a href="http://www.jku.at/content">Johannes Kepler University</a>, Linz, Austria.
</p>



<p>She holds a PhD in Technical Sciences from Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria.
  Her PhD thesis was advised by Professor <a href="http://www.risc.jku.at/people/tjebelea/">Tudor Jebelean</a> and
  Professor <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/">Hoon Hong</a> and deals with the (semi-)automatic analysis and synthesis of programs
  using computational logic and polynomial algebra algorithms.

  She also holds a M.Sc. from Johannes Kepler University (2008) and a B.Sc. from West University of Timisoara (2006), both in computer science.
  Her master's and bachelor's theses were partly realized in the framework of the software companies Mindbreeze Software GmbH and, respectively,
  SC memIQ SRL.</p>

<p>In 2021, she was awarded <a href="https://fulbright.ro/grant/the-fulbright-raf-scholar-award/">The Fulbright-RAF Scholar Award</a> in the field of Entrepreneurship & Entrepreneurial Studies for spending the Spring Semester of 2022 at
  University of Rochester, AIN Center for Entrepreneurship with the goals of study and independent research, curriculum development, classroom observation and participation in
  community-based entrepreneurial activities.</p>

<p> In 2010, she was awarded the competitive <a href="./poster-last.pdf">DOC-fFORTE-fellowship</a> of the
  <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/austrian-academy-of-sciences/">Austrian Academy of Sciences</a> (June 2011 - November 2012).

  In the framework of <a href="http://www.marshallplan.at/">Marshall Plan Foundation</a> scholarship, she spent five months (January - June 2011) at
  <a href="https://www.math.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a>, Raleigh, USA, working under the supervision of Professor Hoon Hong.
</p>

<p>She is interested in developing algorithmic methods for building and maintaining reliable algorithms. To achieve this goal, she combines theoretical research in
  formal methods, automated theorem proving and computer algebra motivated by practical applications in Cloud Computing, Big Data and Machine/Deep Learning.</p>

<p>She was involved in several projects funded by European Commission and other research funding agencies (in Romania and Austria), as local team leader, member or PI.</p>

<p>As an Innovation Researcher at Continental Automotive Romania SRL she was involved in the concept and development of a Sensor Error Model prototype as well as in Patent writing.</p>

<p>As an Innovation Labs Ambassador she encourages entrepreneurial mindset and initiatives of students of Computer Science, but not only, at West University.
