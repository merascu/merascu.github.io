M&#259;d&#259;lina ERA&#350;CU has been Lecturer in the <a href="http://math.uvt.ro/">Department of Computer Science</A>, 
<a href="http://www.uvt.ro/">West University of Timisoara</A>, Romania, since February 2016, and Researcher at 
<a href="http://www.ieat.ro/">Institute e-Austria</a>, since February 2014. 
Prior to these, she had been a Associated Assistant and Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science of the same university
as well as Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://www.risc.jku.at/research/theorema/description/">Theorema</a> group at 
<a href="https://www.risc.jku.at/">Research Institute for Symbolic Computation</a>, 
<a href="http://www.jku.at/content">Johannes Kepler University</a>, Linz, Austria.
</p>
<p>
Her research interests are Formal Methods (Static Software Verification), Distributed Computing (Cloud Computing), Automated Theorem Proving (First-Order Theorem Proving) and Symbolic Computation (Polynomial Algebra). More precisely, she is interested in 
developing algorithmic methods for building and maintaining reliable algorithms. To achieve this goal, she combines theoretical research motivated 
by practical applications in formal methods, automated theorem proving and computer algebra. Recently, she started investigating Cloud Computing research and tries to apply her earlier expertise in this exciting research area.
</p>
<p>
She holds a PhD in Technical Sciences from Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria. 
Her PhD thesis was advised by Professor <a href="http://www.risc.jku.at/people/tjebelea/">Tudor Jebelean</a> and 
Professor <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/">Hoon Hong</a> and deals with the (semi-)automatic analysis and synthesis of programs 
using computational logic and polynomial algebra algorithms.

She also holds a M.Sc. from Johannes Kepler University (2008) and a B.Sc. from West University of Timisoara (2006), both in computer science. 
Her master's and bachelor's theses were partly realized in the framework of the software companies Mindbreeze Software GmbH and, respectively, 
SC memIQ SRL.</p>

<p> In 2010, she was awarded the competitive <a href="./poster-last.pdf">DOC-fFORTE-fellowship</a> of the
<a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/austrian-academy-of-sciences/">Austrian Academy of Sciences</a> (June 2011 - November 2012).

In the framework of <a href="http://www.marshallplan.at/">Marshall Plan Foundation</a> scholarship, she spent five months (January - June 2011) at 
<a href="https://www.math.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a>, Raleigh, USA, working under the supervision of Professor Hoon Hong.
