<!-- <H1>Research Overview</H1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p> My current research goal is to develop
<ul>
<li> mathematical theories </li>
<li> algorithms </li>
<li> software libraries/packages </li>
</ul>
for efficiently solving non-linear constraints, arising in science and engineering, and declarative language design. 
</p>

<p>A constraint is an expression (well formed formula) involving rational numbers, variables (ranging over real numbers), arithemetic functions such 
as +, -, * , /, relations such as =, >, >=, logical connectives such as and , or , not , quantifers such as forall and exists 
(formally a formula in the first order theory of real closef field).</p> 

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The main motivation for tackling this problem comes from the observation that numerous problems in science and engineering can be reduced to that of solving constraints. 
Thus, making progress in solving constraints will have a significant impact on those areas.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I try to achieve efficiency by Developing new/better mathematical theories and more efficient algorithms. Utilizing the structure (in particular composition). Allowing approximate answers (but to a given precision).
Parallelism. -->
