    <H1>Entrepreneurship</H1>
    <p style="color:blue">Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</p>
    <p>In the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of West University of Timisoara started on the academic year 2020 - 2021 a series of
        meetings called <b>Entrepreneurship Caf&eacute</b>. These aim to be informal meetings that facilitate the learning and practice of
        entrepreneurship targeted for Computer Science students (and not only). As a bonus, students can make new friends, build new relationships and get
        inspired.</p>
    <p>Meetings are held online on Wednesdays every 2 weeks, usually from 6 PM, except students vacations and exam sessions. We alternate theory meetings
        with guests (local/national/international entrepreneurs).</p>
    <p>To receive news about our meetings or related event, subscribe to our mailing list: <b>entrepreneurship_cafee at e-uvt dot ro</b>.</p>

<!-- <H1>Research Overview</H1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p> My current research goal is to develop
<ul>
<li> mathematical theories </li>
<li> algorithms </li>
<li> software libraries/packages </li>
</ul>
for efficiently solving non-linear constraints, arising in science and engineering, and declarative language design. 
</p>

<p>A constraint is an expression (well formed formula) involving rational numbers, variables (ranging over real numbers), arithemetic functions such 
as +, -, * , /, relations such as =, >, >=, logical connectives such as and , or , not , quantifers such as forall and exists 
(formally a formula in the first order theory of real closef field).</p> 

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The main motivation for tackling this problem comes from the observation that numerous problems in science and engineering can be reduced to that of solving constraints. 
Thus, making progress in solving constraints will have a significant impact on those areas.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I try to achieve efficiency by Developing new/better mathematical theories and more efficient algorithms. Utilizing the structure (in particular composition). Allowing approximate answers (but to a given precision).
Parallelism. -->
