    <H2>Project Overview</H2>
    <p> Our life depends on software and systems using software. Nowadays, software is complex and, hence, error-prone.
        In order to overcome this problem, we need methods for assisting the software development.
        This project addresses the challenging problem of program analysis by developing rigorous mathematical techniques
        dealing with the logically complex parts of software. At this aim, we will use, refine and combine methods from
        satisfiability checking, graph neural networks and symbolic computation.
        These will make possible the analysis of software that is beyond the power of existing methods since advanced
        symbolic computation techniques (invariant theory) and graph neural networks combined with satisfiability
        checking (SAT/SMT solving) is not exploited in the state-of-the-art program analysis methods and tools.
        e are going to develop new theory and algorithms that detects the problem symmetries and similarities in
        family of problems by combining invariant theory, graph neural networks and SAT/SMT solving which,
        unlike state-of-the-art, would allow solving efficiently theoretically intractable problems.
        Our research project targets the analysis of complex software and follows three main research directions:
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Methods for symmetry breaking and for learning problems similarities</li>
        <li> Theory and algorithms
        <li> Tools and evaluations
        </ol>

        <li>Following our work on binarized neural networks for traffic signs reconition, we have sent <a href="https://github.com/apostovan21/vnncomp2023">benchmarks</a>
            for assessing the local robustness of the trained models to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/vnn2023">VNN-COMP 2023</a>.
            The trained models involve layers as binarized convolution (as provided by <a href="https://docs.larq.dev/larq/api/layers/#quantconv2d">Larq</a> library), max pooling, batch normalization and dense
